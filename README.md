#This project is purely an educational endavor to personally learn react more following a tutorial on Scrimba.com
Main features I am learning are connecting to an API, using reacthooks instead of traditional classes, and styling. 
Time allowing I intend to add further customized functionality and styles on my own to make the app my own work by the end.
